## Requirements Extraction Preview

### What These Add to Basic Package

**Beyond "red dragon at sunset" prompts, we now need:**

**Art Style Datatypes:**
- rendering_techniques (low-poly, voxel, pixel, vector)
- display_types (CRT, arcade, LCD, terminal)
- print_methods (woodblock, screen, lithograph)
- historical_movements (constructivist, bauhaus, art nouveau)
- compression_artifacts (JPEG blocks, datamosh, glitch)

**Format Datatypes:**
- presentation_types (infographic, blueprint, field guide, manual)
- panel_layouts (comic, storyboard, instruction steps)
- interface_overlays (HUD, terminal, security cam)

**Perspective Datatypes:**
- unusual_angles (ant's eye, nadir, through objects)
- optical_effects (fish-eye, kaleidoscope, stereoscopic)
- frame_devices (keyhole, window, scope, reflection)

**Constraint Datatypes:**
- color_limitations (4-color, 16-bit, monochrome, duo-tone)
- resolution_limits (8-bit, 16-bit, low-poly count)
- medium_textures (parchment, graph paper, newsprint, phosphor)

**Era Markers:**
- decade_aesthetics (40s patriotic, 60s psychedelic, 80s neon, 90s grunge)
- cultural_movements (soviet, bauhaus, memphis, vaporwave)

## Validation Strategy (Enhanced)

### Testing These Prompts

**For each category, generate 10-20 variations:**
- Do low-poly prompts feel appropriately chunky?
- Do propaganda posters have right bold simplicity?
- Do glitch effects look intentional not broken?
- Do comic panels follow visual language?
- Do technical diagrams stay clear and functional?

**Quality metrics:**
- Style consistency (does "pixel art" really look pixel art?)
- Constraint adherence (is 4-color really 4 colors?)
- Format appropriateness (blueprints actually technical?)
- Aesthetic appeal (is it good art in that style?)

**Emergence tests:**
- Can we mix styles successfully?
- Do unusual combinations work or break?
- Is variety within each style sufficient?
- Are constraints enabling or limiting?

## Next Steps (Updated)

**Use this expanded list to:**
1. Identify minimal datatypes for ALL categories (traditional + creative)
2. Design hierarchies that support style variations
3. Define tag coordination for style constraints
4. Build modular system where styles can combine

**Priority:**
1. Traditional categories (1-7) - foundation
2. Game art (8) - high demand, clear constraints
3. Technical (9) - unique offering
4. Propaganda (10) - strong visual identity
5. Experimental (11) - cutting edge
6. Comics (12) - distinct rules
7. Texture (13) - specialized
8. Perspective (14) - creative framing

**Build iteratively:**
- Start with traditional + one creative category
- Validate approach works
- Add more creative categories
- Test cross-category combinations

**Total prompts designed: 140** (70 traditional + 70 creative)  
**Total categories: 14** (7 traditional + 7 creative)  
**Status:** Ready for comprehensive requirements extraction! ✅

**The "magic sauce" is in the diversity and uniqueness of these styles!** 🎨✨
